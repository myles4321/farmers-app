#  **AgriSense**


**Welcome to AgriSense!** AgriSense is designed to provide farmers with detailed responses, using Generative AI, based on their location. Our system identifies a user's location through an API, which is then passed on to weather and soil APIs as this information is crucial for farmers. By leveraging Generative AI, and incorporating methods such as langchain for embedding, our system provides detailed and accurate farming solutions.

Additionally, we have an integrated WhatsApp bot, capable of handling both images and text. This bot has been trained on the PlantVillage dataset using transfer learning (ResNet). More information on this feature can be found in its dedicated repository.

## **Purpose of AgriSense**

AgriSense aims to address the challenges faced by farmers by providing accurate and location-specific farming solutions using the power of Generative AI.
